**cps-sat** is a small constraint modeling library built around Boolean formulae in conjunctive normal form (CNF), designed for use with external SAT solvers such as [Kissat](https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat). It provides a Python interface for constructing problems compositionally - from basic propositional atoms to reification, cardinality, and others.

This project originated as part of the Combinatorial Problem Solving course at UPCâ€™s Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics. The coursework portion, focusing on a particular modeled problem, is omitted from this repository. What remains is a general-purpose toolkit for CNF-based modeling, useful in SAT-flavored constraint programming projects.

### Structure

See [this report](CPS_MIRI___Boolean_Satisfiability_Project_Report__NLSP_removed_.pdf).

### Example Problem

An example use of the library is provided in `example.py`, located at the top level of the repository. This example models a variation of the classic queens problem: Given a square board of size *N*, a maximum budget *M*, and piece costs *Q*, *R*, and *B* (for queens, rooks, and bishops respectively), the script searches for a configuration of pieces that meets the following conditions:

- Every square on the board must be attacked by at least one piece.
- The total cost of all placed pieces must be less than *M*.
- Pieces can attack *through* one another (i.e., no blocking).

#### Modeling Strategy

- For each board square `(x, y)`, a Boolean variable `is_attacked[x][y]` indicates whether the square is covered. These are all constrained to be `True`.
- For each row, column, and diagonal, a separate variable (e.g. `is_row_attacked[x]`) encodes whether that entire line is attacked. A square being attacked implies that at least one of its row, column, or diagonal lines must be marked as attacked.
- For each square, four variables represent whether it contains a piece that attacks along a particular direction (horizontal, vertical, positive diagonal, or negative diagonal). These link the "line-level" variables to actual piece placements.
- Each square also carries three Boolean variables indicating whether it contains a rook, bishop, or queen. These determine which kinds of directional attackers can exist in that cell. For example, `is_row_attacker[x][y]` implies that the piece there must be a rook or queen.
- Additional constraints ensure:
  - No square contains more than one piece.
  - The total cost of all placed pieces (weighted according to their type) stays below the given budget.

Although some directional-attacker variables could be omitted (since e.g. all row attackers are also column atackers), they are retained here for clarity and extensibility.
